<!-- intro along with my about me -->
 <center>   <div class="box"><h3> Hi there!</h3>Welcome to my page. My name is <b>Lily</b> and I'm located in <i>Silicon Valley</i>. I'm eager to start this cohort and most excited about     going through this experience with my peers as I know it may not be easy but together we can do it! Recently I turned to web development because of my strong interest in problem-solving yet also having the opportunity to create awesome webpages at the same       time. I have the tendency to stay fixated on things until it comes out to how I want it to be.      

    <p> In my spare time, I enjoy making new dishes. So far, I learned to make the following dishes ranked from 1-3 with 1 being my most favorite:</p>
       <ol style="color: lightcoral;text-align:left"> 
           <li> Pot Roast</li>
           <li>Gumbo </li>
           <li>Tofu Soup</li></ol>
    If I'm not experimenting with new dishes, you can find me to doing the following:
        <ul style="color: lightcoral; text-align:left"> 
           <li> Running</li>
           <li>Watching Reality TV </li>
           <li>Snowboarding</li></ul>
